### comparing various rooting algorithms for phylogenetic language trees

To replicate my analysis, you need a virtual environment for python3 in the subdirectory venv. Also, an executable for RAxML (https://cme.h-its.org/exelixis/web/software/raxml/index.html) needs to be in your search path.

The files `asjp18Clustered.csv`, `world_cc.phy`, and `world_sc.phy` in the subdirectory `asjp/` are obtained by applying the procedure described in [JÃ¤ger, G., 2018. Global-scale phylogenetic linguistic inference from lexical resources, Scientific Data 5, 180189, 2018, doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2018.189.](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018189) to the data from [ASJP v. 18](https://asjp.clld.org/).
